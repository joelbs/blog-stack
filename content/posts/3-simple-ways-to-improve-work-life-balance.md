Is there such a thing as a perfect work life balance? Honestly, I don't know, and if there is such a thing please send me the magic recipe. My address is...well I guess I shouldn't include that in here. 

One thing I know for sure is that there are so many ways to improve and continuously improve work life balance. I've practiced this time and time again. It's possible that my suggestions won't work for everyone, but they will work for some.

Let's get to it.

# 3 Simple Ways to Improve Work Life Balance ...

## Have a workspace/work schedule tailored to you ...

Prioritizing your time will set the tone for everything that follows. i find that understanding the difference between important and flexible tasks helps me to manage my workday; as well as, not overstressing my schedule. This simply means if you overburden your workload (i.e take on more than your day can handle) then you won't have time for important tasks that present themselves unexpectedly. It's best to leave space in your day for those unexpected, urgent tasks and move the flexible tasks to a later time. This will reduce unnecessary stress and allows you to give your best to what needs your attention momentarily.

## Have a workspace/work schedule tailored to you ...

Having a workspace/work schedule tailored to you will reduce burnout. Burnout happens when you are overworked and lack balance. I find that a hybrid workplace solution is one of the best ways to avoid burnout, while increasing work life satisfaction. Having a balance between in-office work and remote work will increase your productivity levels, mental energy, and even cut unnecessary expenses (i.e driving to work Monday-Friday). Aside from a hybrid workplace model, having a functional place to work is also important for our bodies. Invest in a comfortable chair, an ergonomic keyboard, a support stand for your laptop, etc. The level of comfort your office space provides is worth the investment.

## Be realistic with yourself ...

Finally, being realistic with yourself will help you to further improve your work life balance. At the end of the day or every Friday set aside time to do a self-analysis. What worked? What didn't? What went wrong, and how can the issue be resolved?

These simple steps have helped improve my work life balance, and I have no doubt they will help to improve your work life balance.
