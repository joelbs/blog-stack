# Coworking Is Here To Stay ...

Wow I can't believe we are less than one month away from the start of 2022! Time is flying by. This has been a big year for WorkSuites! In the opening of two new downtown locations, we've become more concrete in our belief that hybrid coworking is here to stay and we see so much positivity that reflects it.

As we predicted, coworking spaces are continuing to grow and expand across the globe, but at rates that exceed our original predictions. What's the hype all about you may wonder? Here are 5 reasons to join a coworking space in 2022!

## 1. Community

Working from home can be fun at first, but eventually you'll start to feel isolated and lonely. Coworking will end this feeling of disconnection stirring up inside of you! One of the most alluring things about coworking is that it allows you to interact and build connections. Each day, you will find yourself working alongside people from all different backgrounds - from entrepreneurs, to startups, to influencers and so many more groups of people. What a better way to build relationships than through time spent working in the same space. Expect to learn a little (or a lot) here and there from many different people!

## 2. Networking

Are you ready to be surrounded with driven, goal-oriented people? Being a part of a coworking space is the best way to add valuable connections to your business that otherwise wouldn't exist had you been working from home. Organically make connections, maybe offer your services, and in return utilize their services as well. You never know who you'll run into that could help move your business forward (or vice versa).

## 3. Creativity

We take pride in the energy our coworking spaces shed! By using bright, fluorescent lights, green accents and custom pieces of artwork our workspace will awaken your creative side!
