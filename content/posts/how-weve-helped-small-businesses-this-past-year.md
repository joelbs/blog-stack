## WorkSuites gives back ...

We asked local Veteran business owners to submit an essay answering the following question: *How would winning an office from WorkSuites help you start or grow your business and improve your quality of life?*

After reviewing many essays, we decided to give away 1 private office to [Recruit2Work](https://recruit2work.com/), a recruiting firm that specializes in placing veterans with jobs, and 4 coworking memberships to other deserving local heroes.

Carmen Joyner - Founder of Recruit2Work - went into the US Air Force in November of 1981. She did basic training in San Antonio, Texas, attended technical school in Rantoul, Illinois, and was permanently stationed in Tampa, Florida at MacDill Air Force Base, where she worked on F-16 aircrafts as a Pneumatic Hydraulic Mechanic.

Recruit2Work helps put veterans to work by offering support for veterans who are looking for work. If you are a veteran, you can be sure that Recruit2Work will help you in your journey of finding employment by placing you in a company that will fit your skill set and culture!

We later partnered with the Dallas Entrepreneurial Center to award a private office to one of their members and the winner was [Howdy Homemade Ice Cream](https://www.howdyhomemade.com/). Howdy Homemade was founded on a steel conviction that the restaurant industry is about people first, then food. This conviction has stood the test of time - over two decades - and guided Tom in opening 13 restaurants. Howdy Homemade was born out of a vision to see and realize the potential of everyone. In an industry inflicted by tremendous turnover, Howdy Homemade is committed to providing job opportunities for people who have been marginalized because of society's misunderstanding of their abilities. 

Howdy Homemade Ice Cream employs people with Autism and Down Syndrome by celebrating this community's unique powers. They are here to change the way businesses, hire, train, and develop their own heroes. Howdy Homemade is leading the way so that more heroes can become contributing members of their organizations.

WorkSuites partnered with Texas food banks over the holidays to help feed people in need. Collectively, we were able to provide over 8,400 meals throughout Texas and raised over $1,800 as a whole.
