Coworking is now a major competitor in the office space industry. We are seeing more and more companies show interest in coworking as a hybrid work solution.

According to a new report from CBRE group, North Texas is second with Manhattan falling in first place for flexible office space.

CBRE has seen an increase in requests for flexible office space companies. With over five-million square feet of coworking in North Dallas and LA just right behind us, more and more companies are transitioning to coworking for a hybrid work place solution.

Hybrid coworking offers many advantages for companies looking to cut unnecessary overhead costs such as having a flexible office space agreement that is on a month to month basis rather than being on the hook for several years like traditional office space would require.
