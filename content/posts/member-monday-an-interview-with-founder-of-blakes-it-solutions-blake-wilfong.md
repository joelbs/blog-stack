**"Business Spotlight" is a series of interviews featuring business owners in Texas that office with WorkSuites. We discuss all things business - the motivation behind being your own boss, the successes and failures with running a business, how to deal with challenging obstacles, and advice that every aspiring entrepreneur should know.**

Blake Wilfong is the owner and founder of the Dallas based IT company - Blakes IT Solutions. Developed so that companies can save money and space, Blakes IT Solutions is the answer to IT work for small businesses globally.

**WS: Blake, tell us a little about yourself**

BW: Hi, so I'm Blake Wilfong, I'm 28 years old and I run IT and marketing for a fair amount of companies.

**WS: Tell us a little about your business**

BW: My business is an IT firm that was developed so that companies don't have to pay a full time IT staff, they can outsource the work to us, therefore, we don't take up a bunch of dead space. We only work when there is work that needs to be done, the small businesses can save money and focus that money on making themselves more profitable in other areas or focus that on pushing marketing and we can just take care of all the IT problems that come up with their website or whatever else happens with them.

**WS: What inspired you to start your business**

BW: I was really upset about the prices that people were being charged for IT work and that people were being charged $10,000 for something that would take a couple of minutes. I thought that was very dishonest because sometimes IT staff wouldn't work that hard and they would essentially tell a customer that they were spending more time working than they actually were. I felt there was a very bad transparency because most people don't know the technical side of IT and then when you get someone that comes in that actually does then there's a real time frame for something it a lot of times is hard for the customer to realize and understand. So I was just upset about how dishonest the industry was.

**WS: What made you choose Dallas, Texas as a place to run your business**

BW: I run a small business and I like a lot of the freedoms in Dallas specifically for my business so because Dallas has been promoting such business mindset and small businesses in general it was a perfect fit for me because we didn't shut down during the pandemic, they were looser on a lot of regulations for businesses, I felt that I could come here and my business would be profitable if it was in a public space.

**WS: Did you have doubts about your business succeeding? If so, what were those doubts and how did you overcome it**

BW: I would say that I always have doubts about whether my business is going to succeed. I think that because I own it I know how much I need to make per month and I know how much I have to pay my employees, and what my expenses are. The thing that scares me is that it's really dependent on how much customers really enjoy my services, how much they're happy with their business, and how much value they see in me. So of course I have doubts, but typically by the end of the month I'm very happy, very profitable, and I keep moving and hopefully make more money the next month.

**WS: Was there a notable failure that you learned from**

BW: I don't know if I'd say there's a failure in a sense, I think that the flow of business means that you make mistakes, you lose money, but you never lose the time and information there. So I guess I wouldn't like to say that there's a failure I would like to say more that there's experiences that I didn't do well that I'll do better the next time. For instance, when I was promoting at the Phil Heath I wasn't quite prepared and understood exactly what went into it and what time I needed to be there and how to set up everything so there was a quick learning curve there but after that for the next event that I did it was pretty quick and easy to run through.

**WS: In your opinion what are some of the most important qualities you need as an individual and entrepreneur to push through challenging obstacles**

BW: You need to be headstrong. I wouldn't say that you need a good support system, I think that you need to be your own support system, I think that you need to be able to weather the blows whether thats financially or whether that's emotionally or mentally. I think that you need to have a work ethic where I like wake up in the morning and my work starts as soon as I read the first email in the morning and work ends as soon as I finish the last email at night so as soon as I put my phone on the bed stand and as soon as I pick it up in the morning that's when work starts for me and ends. It's always working and you have to be willing to do that so that the reward later on is that you don't have to do that.

**WS: Were there people who doubted your business idea**

BW: Yeah everyone. I don't think there were a lot of people that thought it was going to be super successful when I started it, including my dad including everyone around me and it was very very difficult to start swimming and treading above water that's why I say you don't necessarily need a support system you just need to have a strong head and weather the blows.

**WS: What piece of advice would you want your younger self to know as an aspiring entrepreneur**

BW: No matter how fast you want to go in business it's going to flow the way that it flows. So if I push, push, push, push it's not always going to equal results, sometimes you need to take a deep breath and focus on yourself and other parts of your life other than just your business.
