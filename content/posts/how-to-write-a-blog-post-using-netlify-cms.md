# There Should Be One or More Level One Headings (H1)

And then paragraphs of text.

Not too long, but also not too short?

## For the Skimmers, Use Level Two Headings (H2) Like This

It makes it easier for the viewer to find what they want. Or to get back to the section they liked.

### 3 Reasons to Use Level Three (H3) Headings

1) You like doing things in threes

2) You really like bold text

3) Three is your favorite number

## How to Add Images

Cick on the plus sign in the grey area at the top of the CONTENT (OPTIONAL) editor section. Then click "Image". And then add the image.

It will show up like this:

*Note: do you remember the "Please be kind, rewind" stickers on VHS rentals? For images the equivalent would be "Please be kind, resize". But like, they're digital right? So we can't do stickers?*
