## Dining in downtown Fort Worth ...

Instead of saving the best for last, we're going to discuss the best first because we know how precious time is and you've got places to be!

* [Branch and Bird](https://branchbirdfw.com/) - known for serving contemporary shareables that are regionally sourced from small artisan farmers and ranchers. Branch and Bird serves an array of cocktails, beer, and wine on the 12th floor in the Frost Tower - you can be sure to expect surreal skyline views while enjoying phenomenal small, artisan style plates. Expect live music as you sit back and sip your wine every Wednesday and Saturday evening - oh and don't forget to stop in every Wednesday for half-priced bottles of wine when you dine in!

The best part about Branch and Bird - its location. If you are lucky enough to office in our new Fort Worth Downtown location at 640 Taylor St you can expect Branch and Bird to be steps away from your office on the 12th floor!

* [Al Dente Italian Trattoria](https://al-dente-italian-trattoria.business.site/) - Family owned and operated this place serves superior homemade Italian food!
