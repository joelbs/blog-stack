Oh books, I know we have a love hate relationship with them. For some of us, books bring us so much joy while for others they are a waste of time. As for me, I have to say I'm one of those who cannot fall asleep without a book in my hand.

It's never too early (or late) to receive financial tips, and what better way to learn about managing finances than to read about it!

# 5 financial help books you're missing out on ...

## Unshakeable by Tony Robbins

Not only will you learn from Tony Robbins himself, but you will learn from those he has known and worked with, some of the wealthiest investors to human kind. The principles are practical. Anyone who reads this book will be set up for long-term success.

## Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill

This book is an absolute classic. Most of you have probably already read this book by now, and if so good for you!  If you are new to financial help books, I highly suggest you start with this one. Be prepared to do tasks outside of reading, such as writing daily goals, writing steps on how to reach your goals, and reciting them.

## The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel

Housel is a master in storytelling. After reading this book you'll understand what money means to us, the psychology of how we spend and invest, the psychology of how money connects who we are today to who we might be tomorrow. You'll understand the term "risk" from multiple perspectives and you might just be surprised what it reveals. The best part is that this is a quick read...\*cough \*cough for those who don't like to read.

## Rich Dad Poor Dad: What The Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not! by Robert T. Kiyosaki

This is a book you can't skip! A few things you'll take from this book: don't bury your failures, the poor and middle class work for money while the rich have money work for them, learn to use your emotions to think, not think by your emotions. Curious to learn more? Don't wait, get started on this book before 2022!

## Everyday Millionaires by Chris Hogan

If you want a read that is straight up counter culture, I suggest this one! This book debunks the myths of how people get rich and encourages the reader to slowly build wealth over time. You would be surprised how many "everyday millionaires" you are surrounded by...just take a look around.

Honestly, this list could go on and on, but I don't want to overwhelm you. Instead, I encourage you to choose one of the five discussed here and start reading! Plus, look where we live...this is Texas! That means go outside and soak up the beautiful sunshine. Put a quilt down, silence your phone, and zone into what's right in front of you.
